If you did not purchase your domain through HostGrid it will not be available for you to manage in your HostGrid control panel.

We recommend that you transfer your domain from your old registrar to us so that you have access to all your domain records and have full control of your domain within your Â control panel. So that you can manage all of your website's needs within one easy-to-use portal.

If you did not purchase your domain through HostGrid you will need to point your domain to HostGrid in order for visitors to have access to your website.

Pointing your domain to us is simply connecting your domain name to our servers (where your files are stored) and is required to get your website up and running on HostGrid's servers.
