# How do I create an account with HostGrid?

Creating an account with HostGrid can be done in minutes and will set you up with a professional web hosting subscription.  We do not offer free access to our services, instead you will need to follow our sign up process, choose a domain name and then a subscription term to create your account.

Please click any of the yellow ‘Get Started’ buttons on our website which will take you to our domain page.  Here you can choose to register a new domain or transfer an existing domain to us. Next you create your account by entering your name, email address and a password of your choice.  Following this please choose the term of your subscription from monthly to 12, 24 or 36 months and enter your payment details.

Once you have followed these steps you will have created a web hosting account with HostGrid and you’ll be given access to your control panel to start building your website.
