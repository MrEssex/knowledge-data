# I want a website, where do I begin?

So you have made the exciting decision to start a website! Knowing exactly what you need to think about is tough, especially if this is your first time. So let's go through the key areas that you need to think about and focus on:

- How do you want to build your website?
- Do you need a hosting solution like Plesk?
- Do you want to use an easy-to-use, drag-and-drop website builder?
- How much can you afford to spend a month on your web hosting?
- Do you have a company budget to keep within?
- Do you need to register a domain or do you already own the domain you want to host?
- How quickly do you expect your website to grow?
- Do you need lots of storage space, marketing tools, and website analytic programs?
