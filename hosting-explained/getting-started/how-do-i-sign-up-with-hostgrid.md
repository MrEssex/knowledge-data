# How do I sign up with ​HostGrid​

Signing up to HostGrid couldn’t be easier, the 3 simple things you will need to hand are:

- An idea of the domain name you’d like to register - please remember it’s rare to get the exact domain you would like so we recommend having a few options to hand and be flexible with the TLD (.com, .co.uk, .org etc...) you’d like.
- Your contact details - your name, the email address you’d like to use for hosting communications, and a password.
- Your payment details - we accept credit or debit card or PayPal

Once you have these all you need to do is [click here](https://secure.hostgrid.com/?domain=&amp;tld=com&amp;search=www) and follow the simple steps. We’ll have you online within minutes!
