# How do I register a domain with HostGrid?

You will receive a free domain name for life when you create a hosting subscription with HostGrid and you can register your chosen domain during the signup process. 

[Click here](https://secure.hostgrid.com/?domain=&amp;tld=com&amp;search=www) to set up your domain name, or click on any of the yellow Get started buttons. 
From here you can choose to register a new domain. You can also use an existing domain that you own. If you choose to register a new domain you can type the domain that you would like into the domain box and then choose the TLD you would like from the dropdown.

You cannot register a domain with HostGrid if you do not have a hosting subscription with us. To create a subscription please [click here](https://secure.hostgrid.com/?domain=&amp;tld=com&amp;search=www). Once your subscription is set up you can register as many domains as you would like through your HostGrid control panel [here](https://my.hostgrid.com/domains.).
