# What is web hosting?

Web hosting basically allows you to rent or buy space to house your website on the internet.

When a hosting provider allocates you space on their web server for your website to store its files, they are hosting your website for you.

The amount of space allocated on a server to a website depends on the type of hosting. The main types of hosting are shared, dedicated, VPS and reseller. They are differentiated by the kind of technology used for the server, the level of management provided, and the additional services on offer.

****How does it work?****

Web hosting is when the files that make up a website are uploaded from your local computer onto a web server. The serverâ€™s resources, (RAM, hard drive space, and bandwidth) are allocated to your websites.

The division of server resources varies depending on the type of hosting plan that you have chosen.
