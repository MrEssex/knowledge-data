# What is shared web hosting

Shared hosting allows anyone with a need for a website to get online quickly and cost-effectively.

Web Hosting is the term used for the allocated server space a website is stored on. With shared hosting, your website will share the space on a server with other websites of a similar size, helping to keep your costs down. Shared Hosting packages come with helpful and reliable support, easy-to-use website building tools and are suitable for anyone new to getting online up, including small businesses.
