# How do I register a domain with HostGrid?

You will receive a free domain name for life when you create a hosting subscription with HostGrid and you can register your chosen domain during the signup process.

All you need to do is click any of the yellow ‘Get Started’ buttons and you will be taken to the domain page.  Here you can choose to register a new domain or use an existing domain that you own.  If you choose to register a new domain you can type the domain that you would like into the domain box and then choose the TLD you would like from the dropdown.

You cannot register a domain with HostGrid if you do not have a hosting subscription with us.  To create a subscription please visit [https://secure.](https://secure.hostgrid.com/?)[hostgrid.com/](https://secure.hostgrid.com/)  Once your subscription is set up you can register as many domains as you would like through your HostGrid control panel at [https://my.hostgrid.com/domains](https://my.hostgrid.com/domains).

We offer a wide range of top-level domains such as .xyz, .name, .work, country code TLDs including .us, .co.uk, .com.au and .eu along with the popular TLDs like .com, .org and .net.
