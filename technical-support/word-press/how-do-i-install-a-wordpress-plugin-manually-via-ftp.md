# How do I install a WordPress plugin manually via FTP?

Step 1 - Ensure that you have downloaded your WordPress plugin to your device.

If downloaded as a zip archive, extract the plugin folder to your desktop. This is very important as files must be extracted in order to be uploaded properly to the wp-content/plugins folder.

Step 2 - With your FTP program, upload the plugin folder to the ‘wp-content/plugins’ folder in your WordPress directory.

Step 3 No go to the available option ‘Plugins’ where you will find the newly uploaded Plugin in the list.

Step 3 - You will now need to click on the available option ‘Activate Plugin’ to activate it.
