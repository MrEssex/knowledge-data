Wordpress is one of the most popular tools used around the world to create websites.

WordPress uses an easy to follow the structure as a content management system, it is broken down into departments to make it easily accessible to its users. WordPress does the same with websites, a website is structured with different components, a menu, header, footer, page content, sidebar and much more. The greatest advantage of WordPress is that you don’t need to be a developer to build your site!

Below are some other benefits of using WordPress and what it makes it stand out from the rest.

It’s free! WordPress is open-source software. There can be other costs if you decide to use some of the premium features like themes and plugins.

You don’t need to be a developer or programmer! That is right, you need no knowledge of HTML, CSS, JSON, Javascript etc. WordPress handles all of this for you, so you don’t have to worry about any programming language.

A stockpile of Themes and Plugins, when using WordPress you are not limited to what you initially see. As you start going through WordPress you will see the different Themes and Plugins that are available to you and you can also pay a little extra for a premium Theme or Plugin if that is what you think will make your Website or Blog stand out from the rest.

There is no page limit to your WordPress site!
