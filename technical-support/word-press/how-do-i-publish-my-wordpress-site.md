# How do I publish my WordPress site?

Are you ready to launch your website!

Here is a checklist to make sure:

- After installing and activating additional plugins, review and proof your entire website to make sure the new plugins are working properly.
- Test the contact and subscriptions forms if your website has them. Make sure that the correct email addresses are receiving the notifications from those forms.
- Confirm that the contact information throughout the whole site is correct. A typo error can prevent someone from contacting you.
- View your website on a mobile and tablet device. Many themes are already responsive and will automatically adjust the content to fit different devices.
- Clean up your installed plugins. If you know that you no longer need a plugin, make sure to deactivate and delete the plugin.
- Clean up the installed themes. You want to keep at least 2-3 themes installed. One being the active theme.
- If you have links on your website, make sure they work properly. If you direct someone off your website, have the link open in a new tab.
- Make sure that your website is using an SSL. Install the Really Simple SSL plugin to quickly and easily force the site over an SSL.
- On the home page, the purpose of your site must be clear to a visitor and direct them to their next step be it calling you, viewing products, reading more, etc.

Finally, you are now able to launch your website! If you haven't done so already, click the click here link at the top of your dashboard that states, "Your site is currently displaying a "Coming Soon" page. Once you are ready to launch your site select the available option ‘click here’
