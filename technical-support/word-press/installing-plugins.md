To install a plugin you will need to:

Tips when selecting a plugin:

Star Rating: Look to see how many stars that plugin has been rated along with how many people have rated it. 5 stars with only 1 review is different from 4.5 stars and 633 reviews.

Last Updated: Select a plugin that is being maintained and updated by the plugin’s developer. An outdated plugin may not work or function correctly with your updated WordPress version or theme.

Active Installations: It is nice to see when a plugin is popular as it’s a great indication that others have found it useful and successful. Keep in mind though that you might happen upon a new plugin which has yet to be discovered by other users.

Compatible with your version of WordPress: Make sure to select a plugin that has been tested and is compatible with your version of WordPress. You will want to make sure that it plays nicely with your core WordPress files.
