# Changes I have made on my WordPress site are not showing when I try to access it

An issue like this is often caused by the cache functionality of certain performance plugins for WordPress.

To review your changes, you should clear the cache of those plugins. It is located in a folder called wp-content/cache/.

You should delete the content of the cache/ folder either by FTP or via File Manager in your cPanel, clear the cache of your web browser and reload your website.
