# How do I customize a block?

Most of the Blocks that you can use allow customizations to be done directly within the block itself. When editing a block a formatting bar will appear and provide the options that you will need.

In the right-hand sidebar, there is a tab called ‘Block’ this tab will provide additional formatting options.

To rearrange a Block on your page/post:

Step 1 - Hover your mouse over the block you would like to rearrange.

Step 2 - Around the left side of the block and the navigation option will appear.

Step 3 - Select the visible arrow up or down to move the block above or below the others direct next to the selected block.

Step 4 - By holding your mouse on the visible dots, will allow you to grab the block and move it to a new location with the content of your pages.
