# How do I create and manage a post?

Firstly to add a New Post

Step 1 - You will need to log into your WordPress Dashboard

Step 2 - Now hover over the option ‘Post’ and on the left-menu click the option ‘Ad New’ from the sub-menu.

Step 3 - Click on the option ‘+’ that you will see on the new post, displayed on the left-hand corner of your screen. A new menu should appear.

Step 4 - You will be shown the most popular blocks but to use the search option to locate the block that you would like to use.

Step 5 - You simply need to click on the desired block to add it to your post. Then again if you click on the post you will be able to start editing or adding content to it.

****Managing your Post****

Now that you have created a post, there are some features you can use to manage and customize them even further.

You can access these options under the ‘Posts tab’ on the left-hand side menu in the WordPress dashboard.

You can either hover your mouse over the option ‘Posts’ to see these options in a sub-menu or click on the option ‘Posts’ to see them listed directly under Posts.

- All Posts - This will show you all of the posts created on the WordPress website. It provides a quick outline and lists each post title, author, a category it has been assigned to, tags, comments, and date it was published or last modified. You can customize what items are displayed for a post by clicking the Screen Options in the upper right-hand corner.

- Categories - The Categories option allows you to categorize your posts as you see fit. You can choose the name of your category, customize how the URL looks, and even create parent categories. To clarify on parent categories, you can have the main category of Houses and subcategories underneath that (referred to as child categories) such as Cabins, Apartments, Mobile Homes, etc. A post can be assigned to multiple categories, as well. For example, you might have an apartment that is also a cabin which you could assigned to both categories. Categories are a broad way of structuring one's posts and making it easier for viewers to find the content that there are looking to read.

- Tags - Tags are used on posts to focus on a specific topic, unlike categories which could have an extensive range of topics and items. An example would be you have a category for Movies. You could then tag a post with 'Drama' and 'Academy Award Winning' as tags to further outline the contents of the post.
