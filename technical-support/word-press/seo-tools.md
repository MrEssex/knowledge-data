# SEO tools

You can optimize your site for search engines and social media by taking advantage of the SEO tools onside WordPress. The features are only available in the WordPress.com Business or eCommerce plans and the Jetpack Premium and Professional Plans for your self-hosted site.

Front Page Meta Description

1. Meta descriptions are a general overview of the contents of your site.
2. Search engines sometimes use this information to determine the site’s relevance for specific searches.
3. This meta description setting applies to your site’s front page only. To access the front page meta description editor, visit [https://wordpress.com/marketing/traffic](https://wordpress.com/marketing/traffic).

Custom Post Meta Description

The SEO Description option is currently not available on our Block Editor. Instead, utilize the excerpt box to provide a description of your post or page.

1. Typically, search engines will pick up on the post content and use that as the description that is displayed in the search results
2. With SEO Tools you can customize the meta description to be something different to both catch the eye of the reader and potentially increase the search page ranking of the post.
3. To customize the description, expand the SEO Description drop down at the right side of the editor and then enter the custom description you would like to use. Upon saving the post you should see the description update on most search engines within a few hours.

Custom Title Formats

To help improve your search page ranking, you can customize how your content titles appear for your site. You can reorder items such as ‘Site Name’ and ‘Tagline’, and also add custom separators between the items.

Search and Social Previews

Before you publish your new post or page, you can use the SEO preview tool to see how it will look on search engines and social media. To do so, go to any post or page and select Preview. Then change the dropdown menu to Search and Social

The previews will use the custom description you set in the Advanced SEO meta description settings so you can get an idea on how it will look on the WordPress.com Reader, Google, Facebook and Twitter.
