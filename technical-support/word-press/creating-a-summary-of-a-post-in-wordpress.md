# Creating a summary of a post in WordPress

If you would like to create a summary of your post or even add a “More….” link to your post, Below is how you can do this in WordPress.

For a new post, you will need to go to your blog's admin area then go to Posts and next Add New.

To add the "More..." link to the post, click the Insert more tag button in the WYSIWYG editor menu above the message body.

If you would like to write your posts in HTML mode, you can use the tag instead. It should be added after the text of your post.

To create a summary for your post, simply write it in the Excerpt field, then click Publish to save and publish your new post.
