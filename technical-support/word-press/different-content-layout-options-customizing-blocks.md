# Different content layout options & customizing blocks

You will notice that WordPress is using the Gutenberg editor as the default editor. This editor is also known as a block editor that allows more customized options when building a website and adding content.

So I hear you sayingâ€¦.What is a block editor? Each piece of content is a block that you use to construct your page or post.

A block can be titled as content, video, image, image gallery, buttons and a lot more. Each block is separated from each other and this allows you to customize the blocks better.
