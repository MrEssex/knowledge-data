# My WordPress theme is not showing

If a new uploaded theme is not showing up, you should first make sure that you have uploaded it in the right location which is wp-content/themes in your WordPress installation folder.

There are times when the themes are bundled in their own subdirectory and when you extract them, the files don't go into the correct subdirectory in wp-content/themes.

For instance, a theme called mytheme might be incorrectly placed in: wp-content/themes/mytheme/mytheme In that case you need to put the theme's files in: wp-content/themes/mytheme
