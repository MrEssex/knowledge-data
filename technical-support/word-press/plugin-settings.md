# Plugin settings

Some plugins will require a little help to complete the set-up before they will work correctly. To edit your plugin you will need to access the settings:

Step 1 - Log into the WordPress Dashboard

Step 2 - hover over ‘Plugin’ in the left-hand menu and then click on the available option ‘Installed Plugins’ in the sub-menu. Here you will see a list of plugins that are installed on the WordPress site.

Step 3 - You will see either ‘Activate/Delete’ or Settings/Deactivate’ under the ‘Plugins’ title, Click the available option ‘Settings’ which will allow you to edit the setting of the plugin. As you can see, you can also ‘Deactivate’ the plugin as well.
