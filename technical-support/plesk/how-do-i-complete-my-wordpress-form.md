# How do I complete my WordPress form?

In Plesk you can install useful server apps. A lot of the app’s will help to speed up the process of getting your website live and adding additional features.

Firstly, go to Applications. From here you can click ‘All Available Applications’ to find applications to use with your HostGrid hosting.

Select ‘Install’ to install the application. Once installed, you will be able to access the application through the ‘Manage my Application’ page.

Please note, that not all applications may be compatible with your hosting, as older applications that are not updated may become unsupported on newer server software. If you have any issues, please reach out to support@hostgrid.com
