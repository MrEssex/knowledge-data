# How do I create a new folder?

Creating folders is very similar to using a file manager in Windows, Mac or Linux.

To create a new folder select the ‘New’ button and select ‘Create Directory’.

The folder will be created within the folder you are currently in, to create a folder within another just select and open the folder.

As with operating systems, you will only be able to use certain characters. To make things easier we recommend using underscores instead of spaces.
