# How do I change my Plesk password

There is no need to change your Plesk password, as you login through your HostGrid account.

To reset your HostGrid password, [please click here](https://account.hostgrid.com/) and click 'Forgotten Your Password?'.

You can also link another account, such as Google, Facebook, or GitHub to login to Plesk by navigating to ‘Account’ and then clicking ‘My Profile’.
