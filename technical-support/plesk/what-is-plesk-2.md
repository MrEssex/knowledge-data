# What is Plesk?

Used by millions of websites, Plesk simplifies your hosting management experience. It encompasses a wealth of tools and applications that will help you build and host your ideal website. With over 20 years of continuous development you know you'll not be left behind.

Its intuitive graphical interface (which is even great on mobile!) will allow you to take control of your hosting. From file management to email management, you're always just a few clicks to view and change whatever you need on the go. The easy to use frontend is also matched with a robust and reliable backend, which is why we highly recommend Plesk. And it doesn't just stop there, Plesk can be extended to go even further with extensions and applications of your choosing.

Widely recognized for its strong security, you can rest assured your content is safe and secure.
