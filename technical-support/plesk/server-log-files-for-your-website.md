# Server log files for your website

Logs for each website are accessible from the ‘Website & Domains’ page. Click ‘logs’ to load the logs page for the chosen domain/website. These files are stored periodically and can be accessed to understand errors on the website.

Plesk also uses these files to analyse and provide statistics on things such as who is visiting the website (browser, operating system, location, page viewed).
