# How do I manage my sites database?

You can assign a database to a specific website by selecting the ‘Assign this database to a site’.

To manage the users who will have access to the database, select the ‘User Management’ button on the far right side of the page. Here you will be able to add and remove users, as well as manage their access rights.

Access rights for a user can be limited to just being able to read, or being able to read and write to the database. You can also limit the ability of actions they can do within the database, such as allowing them to write additional information to a database, but being unable to remove data from the database.

For further managing of the database,, open the phpMyAdmin for the database.
