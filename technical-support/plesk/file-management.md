# File management

Plesk’s file manager will allow you easy access to your website files, on your web browser.

By default the Home Directory, which is “/”, is considered the root directory - it is the first level of directory.

Files and folders beginning with ‘.’ are System files - so a good rule of thumb is not to touch these as they are created and updated automatically - they must likely control something really important. You can disable showing these by using settings.
