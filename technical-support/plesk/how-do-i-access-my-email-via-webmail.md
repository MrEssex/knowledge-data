# How do I access my email via webmail?

Plesk will allow you and users to access email through your web browser, using the email address and password. To do this navigate to visit ‘webmail.domain.com’, where ‘domain.com’ is the Internet address of your website.

If you cannot open the webmail page, make sure that a webmail is enabled. Open the Mail section, then the Mail Settings tab, click the name of the domain and select a webmail client in the Webmail menu.
