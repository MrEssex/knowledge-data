# Databases

Without databases a lot of the more advanced features and extensions available for your website wonâ€™t work. Fortunately, Plesk will also help you manage the databases needed to be able to get the most out of your hosting.

When Plesk and your first domain is setup, you will automatically have the main database created, which will be used by your content management system (such as WordPress).
