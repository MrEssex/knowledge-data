# How do I use my file manager?

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lMq1L7Zuj5U4zSwJvkZ3xTCptngUm6bt3HI3vS6Wc-Udm-Zq5yxvc9_BLqpZ0Pic8bYuFPTGtbguXV-XHKvV2lfnkeFPNAbkw_S4DTAxubgFhWHjgGrC-8_k_VhMEwXoyepQvAa2)
1. ‘Settings’ here you can adjust some basic view settings, such as hiding system files.
2. ‘error_docs’ contains the error pages used by your sites/domains. You can customise these here.
3. As holdingthebestbeerintheworld.com is an additional Domain, it has its own folder for the website.
4. Httpdocs is the primary domain folder - this holds the main website (in this example barrysbigbeerbarrel.com)
5. Logs are stored here, for each domain as well as the Plesk service as a whole. You can download these if needed - but Plesk will use these files elsewhere, such as the Statistics page.
6. As shop.barrysbigbeerbarrel.com is a subdomain, it has its own webpages as well, which are separated in this directory.
