# How do I log into Plesk?

Simply go to your HostGrid account page and click on the button ‘Login to Plesk’ which will take you to and log you into Plesk.

You will have been sent your username and password from HostGrid. If you have problems logging in, [please visit here](https://account.hostgrid.com/) and click 'Forgotten Your Password?' to reset your password.

When you first load up Plesk, HostGrid would have already set a few things up for you automatically.

- WordPress support, so you can create the website, including setting up the database
- Adding all the DNS Zone records so your website is hooked up to the world wide web
- Securing connectivity by issuing and configuring SSL/TLS certificates
