# How do I import my site using Site Builder

If you have used another hosting provider's site builder tool, it is more than likely they will not allow you to access your website's files.

That's why at HostGrid we have included our import any website feature within our Site Builder. This will pull any images and content from any pre-existing website and give you access to them within our website builder.

- Access the [****My Sites Tab****](https://my.hostgrid.com/sites)within your dashboard
- Click ****Manage ****on the site that you would like to action.

- Click ****Import****

You will now have the pictures and content from that website within Site Builder and you will be able to use the drag and drop tools to move them into the correct position.
