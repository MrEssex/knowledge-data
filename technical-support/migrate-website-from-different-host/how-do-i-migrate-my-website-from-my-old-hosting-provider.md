### [Transferring websites files](Transferring websites files)

All the content on your website is stored within files. These files are stored on a server run by your hosting provider.

When switching from your old provider you will need to transfer the files to HostGrid's servers.

****1.[ File transfer via FTP](https://support.hostgrid.com/en/kb/article/245/how-do-i-transfer-my-files-with-ftp)****

Manually transfer your website's files across using an FTP client like FileZilla - [More Info](https://support.hostgrid.com/en/kb/article/245/how-do-i-transfer-my-files-with-ftp)
