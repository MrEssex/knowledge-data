# Can I change my domain name?

If you are not satisfied with the domain name you have registered, you can register a new domain name in the HostGrid domain page. By doing this you will now own both names.

Once the domain registration for the original name is ready to expire, you can simply opt not to renew this domain name (i.e. do not pay the renewal fee).

Once a domain is registered and order is processed (You see the Confirmation message) this domain is yours for the registered period. There is the following exception: Trademark or copyright issue
