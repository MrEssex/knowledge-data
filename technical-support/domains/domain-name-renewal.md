# Domain name renewal

Domains registered with HostGrid are set to automatic renewal, this is to ensure that our customers do not have the potential of losing the domain names.

We notify all our customers that their domain names are due to renew and will also display how much the renewal of there domain is going to be. This notification is sent to our customers no later than 7 days before the renewal will take place.

Please note that if you have disabled the renewal of your domain name, will be unable to process the renewal of your domain name and could be subject to a redemption period or will expire and be available on general sale.
