# What is a subdomain?

A subdomain is directly linked to your main domain as is actually part of it rather than a standalone domain.  A subdomain is commonly used if you would like to divide your website up into sections such as different products, departments or a help center.  You can easily create new subdomains in your cPanel account under the Domains section.
