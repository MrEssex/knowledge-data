# Pointing my domain to a coming soon page

All you have to do to point your website to a "Coming soon" page is create a simple index.html file in the document root directory of your website.

The index.html file should contain the following code:

Coming Soon!

In case you are already using a CMS such a WordPress or Joomla you can set it in maintenance mode.

You can install a “[maintenance mode plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-maintenance-mode/#installation)” on your WordPress, where you will be able to customize your maintenance page. As of Joomla, you can simply follow their official instructions and activate the “[maintenance mode based](https://docs.joomla.org/Taking_the_website_temporarily_offline)” on your application version.
