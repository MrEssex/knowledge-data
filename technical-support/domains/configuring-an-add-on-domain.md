# Configuring an add on domain

Before continuing to use an addon domain please make sure that your hosting account allows this functionality.

Additionally, you need to have a registered domain name too.

Once you make sure you have the addon functionality allowed and the domain name registered you have to add the domain to an addon slot from your cPanel by going to the available option: Addon Domains.
