# Why does my DNS need to propagate?

You may have seen the term ‘propagate’ used in regards to your domain’s DNS and it usually comes with a time frame associated with it.  This is due to the fact that every time a domain is visited a version of it will be stored in cache. This stored version of a website will stay there for an allotted amount of time.  This is why an update can be made to a site and may not then be seen on the live site for 24 hours or more.

The process of propagation is essentially the time it takes for the DNS of any given domain to update their cached version.  The standard time frame agreed is 72 hours for a DNS update, but it regularly will happen a lot quicker than this.
