# How do I point my website to ​HostGrid​?

If you already have an existing domain with another registrar that you want to use with HostGrid, you will first need to "Point" your domain to HostGrid.

There are two ways that you can point your website to HostGrid

- ****Update your domain to use our nameservers.****
- ****Update your domain's "A" records to our IP address.****

### ****Update your domain to use our nameservers.****

The recommended way for a customer to point their website to HostGrid is to use HostGrid's nameservers. This will move all of your domain's existing DNS records to HostGrid. You will then be able to manage your domain fully within your HostGrid control panel.

To point your domain's nameservers to HostGrid please get in touch with your current domain registrar, and tell them that you want your domain to point towards the following:

****ns1.hostgrid.com****

****ns2.hostgrid.com****

****ns3.hostgrid.com****

****ns4.hostgrid.com****

Once you have provided this information, it can take up to 48 hours for your domain to point towards HostGrid

### ****Update your domain's "A" records to our IP address.****

You may want to keep your DNS records in their current location. For example, if you want your website and emails to be hosted through separate servers, then you will want to change your domain'S "a" records.

Changing your domain's "A" record will allow you to use our IP address and servers to host your website.

To update your domain's "A" records to our IP address do the following:

- Go to your ****HostGrid Dashboard****
- Click ****My Sites**** on the navigation bar
- Log in to ****Plesk****
