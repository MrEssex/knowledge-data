# What is ICANN?

ICANN stands for â€˜Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers'

ICANN is a non-profit organization that coordinates a name or number used on the internet across the world.

The goal of ICANN is to keep the internet secure, stable, and interoperable. It also creates policy on the internet's unique identifiers.

ICANN does not control the content or stop SPAM and it does not deal with access to the internet.
