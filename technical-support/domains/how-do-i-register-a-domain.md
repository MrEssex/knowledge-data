# How do I register a domain?

Not only do we provide you with quality web hosting here at HostGrid, we also include a free domain name with our hosting plans.  If you choose to sign up with us we will ask you for the domain you would like to register at the beginning of the process. We will check the domain’s availability and let you know if it is vacant to register or not.  If the domain you want is already taken, we’ll give you available suggestions that are similar to what you had originally searched for. You can choose to register any of these domain suggestions and we’ll secure it for you for free for the first year.

If you know you would like to host your website with us, but are unsure of the domain you’d like or the one you want isn’t available and you need time to think of a new one that is fine.  You can select to skip the domain step and setup your hosting without a domain name assigned to your account. Once your account with us is setup you can visit the domain section at any time, search for available domain names and the first domain you choose to register with us will be free for the first year.
