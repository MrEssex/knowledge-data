# How many domains can I have?

You can register an unlimited number of domains with us.  You can register a new domain at any time through your HostGrid account by selecting the Domains section and searching your desired domain name.  You can then manage this domain in your account and add it to your cPanel as a parked domain if you’d like it to point to your website.
