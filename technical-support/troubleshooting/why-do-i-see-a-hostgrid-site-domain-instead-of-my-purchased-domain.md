# Why do I see a HostGrid.site domain instead of my purchased domain?

Your website hosting and your domain name are seperate entities. They are not nessecarily tied together, nor dependant on each other...

For instance, you can just have hosting with HostGrid, or you can just have a domain name with HostGrid

With any hosting account, there is an underlying sub-domain for every hosted website - and that is exactly what the hostgrid.site domain is! No one will ever see this other than you or users you give access to your HostGrid dashboard. It isn't instead of the domain name you purchased, it is effectively the hidden, behind-the-scenes, hosting domain name of your website.

The domain name you chose for free or transferred to us alongside your hosting package is the domain name that visitors to your website will see, it is what other websites will link to as well as the address that search engines such as Google will list.
