# How do I add a menu?

To begin adding a Menu to your website, click on the ‘Menu’ option shown on your top menu in your website builder.

You will now need to select from the available list, the type of the menu that you would like to add.

Once selected, the Menu box will automatically be added to the available open website space.

To change the default option on your menu, click on the edit button displayed in the grey box with the pencil symbol shown, you will now see the ‘+ New Menu Item’ or the ‘Edit Menu’ option.

Alternative edit option is available by simply double-clicking on the menu box.
