# How do I add social media?

To begin adding Social Media links to your website, click on the ‘Social’ option shown on your top menu in your website builder.

You will now need to select from the available Social list, the type of social widget that you would like to add.

Once selected a Social Media box will be added to the available open website space.

To link to your Social Media page, simply double click on the social media box and add your Page URL to the available field.
