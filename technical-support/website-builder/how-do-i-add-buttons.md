# How do I add buttons?

To begin adding Buttons to your website, click on the ‘Buttons’ option shown on your top menu in your website builder.

You will now need to select from the available list, the media provider that you would like to use.

Currently available to you:

- Text Buttons
- Icon Buttons

Once you have made your selection, your Button will be added to the available open website space.

To edit the Button box, you will need to double click on the ‘Button” box. Once selected you will see the available edit option appear on the pop-up menu.
