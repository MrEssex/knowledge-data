# What is automatic renewal?

All HostGrid hosting plans are set up as subscriptions.  You will be asked to choose a term on sign up and that term governs how regularly your subscription automatically renews.  We set up all our subscriptions to automatically renew to ensure there are no interruptions to any websites or domain names.
