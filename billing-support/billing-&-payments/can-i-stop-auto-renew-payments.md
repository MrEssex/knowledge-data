# Can I stop auto-renew payments?

At HostGrid we feel strongly about the service that we provide to our customers, which is why we provide continuous support. This means you can sit back, relax and have full peace of mind that we have you covered.

We do advise that you regularly check to make sure your payment details on file are up to date to keep your website live.

If, however, this isnâ€™t for you, simply contact us to discuss disabling the setting or manage manually within the billing section of your account.
