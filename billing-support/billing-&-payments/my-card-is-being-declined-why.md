# My card is being declined, why?

There are many simple reasons why your car issuer may decline your transaction, it is usually nothing to worry about.  If your card is declining on our order form or for your subscription renewal please contact your bank.

Once your bank have confirmed your card is working, please try the transaction again or alternatively try a new card or PayPal to make your payment.  We automatically retry renewal payments after a few days. If your website is down due to non-payment please call us so we can retry the transaction.
