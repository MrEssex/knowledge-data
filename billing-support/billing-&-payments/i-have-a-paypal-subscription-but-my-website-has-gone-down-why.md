# I have a PayPal subscription, but my website has gone down, why?

If you choose to pay for your hosting subscription using PayPal, a billing agreement will have been created by PayPal.  PayPal handles the release of funds for this subscription and we can only log the payment when we receive it from them.

If PayPal does not have the available funds in your account with them to send to us they should contact you.  It is advisable to have a bank account associated with your PayPal account as well as multiple cards to avoid this situation.

Please contact PayPal to chase any missed payments, unfortunately they won’t communicate with us regarding our customer’s accounts.
