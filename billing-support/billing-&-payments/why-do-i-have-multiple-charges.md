# Why do I have multiple charges?

We place all our billing transactions individually.  This means if you have bought a hosting plan, an additional domain and an additional service you will see 3 charges on your bank statement from HostGrid.  This will be the same when it comes to renewing each service.

By visiting the Billing & Payment section of your control panel you will find all of your invoices [https://my.hostgrid.com/billing/overview](https://my.hostgrid.com/billing/overview)

If you are unsure about any charges from hostgrid.com feel free to contact us
