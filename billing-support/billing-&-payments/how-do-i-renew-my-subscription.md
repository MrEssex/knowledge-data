# How do I renew my subscription?

In an effort to avoid interruption to your services, we will attempt to automatically process the renewal payment of your HostGrid hosting services on the date shown in your Account on the Billing Overview section of your account, If this isnâ€™t for you though, we'll turn it off, simply email us.

Want to know how much your next payment is going to be? Easy! Everything you need to know about the renewal of your service is available in your Account section, here you can also find out the billing cycle you have signed up to.

Your renewal price will be different from your introductory price. This is because when you joined HostGrid you will have received an introductory discounted rate which on its anniversary will renew at the regular rate. By default accounts are set for auto-renewal to prevent disruption to your service, although this can be turned off at your request.

At HostGrid we have 2 different billing cycles for you to choose from: Monthly or Annual

If you feel you have been charged too much or charged for an upgrade that you did not want, please email us at [billing@hostgrid.com](mailto:billing@hostgrid.com?subject=%7B%7Bbrand.displayName%7D%7D%20Renewal) and we can rectify the situation.

Alternatively, our phone lines are available 24/7
