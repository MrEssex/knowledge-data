# Subscription charge amounts

HostGrid offers subscriptions on a monthly or annual term basis.  It’s common for initial terms to have a promotional discount applied to them which will only apply to that term.

All our subscriptions are set to auto-renew to ensure all websites do not experience any unnecessary downtime.  Taking these points into account, if you are unsure about the amount you have been charged for your hosting subscription please contact us on [billing@hostgrid.com](mailto:billing@hostgrid.com?subject=%7B%7Bbrand.displayName%7D%7D%20Subscription%20Charges) and we will help rectify the situation.

Alternatively, our phone lines are available 24/7
