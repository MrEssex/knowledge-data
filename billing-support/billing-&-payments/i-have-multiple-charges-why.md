# I have multiple charges, why?

When you set up your subscription with HostGrid we offer various additional services, if these have been selected then they will appear as separate charges on a statement and be invoiced separately by us. We apologize for any administrative annoyances this may cause, going forward the renewal payments will be one charge.
