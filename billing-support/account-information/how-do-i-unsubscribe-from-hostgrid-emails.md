# How do I unsubscribe from HostGrid emails?

You can unsubscribe from receiving any emails from HostGrid by visiting [https://www.hostgrid.com/unsubscribe](https://www.hostgrid.com/unsubscribe) and entering the email address assigned to your account.

Please be aware that if you are a paid customer this means you will no longer receive any payment notifications. You will still be able to view your invoices in the Billing & Payment section of our control panel > [https://my.hostgrid.com/billing/overview](https://my.hostplus.com/billing/overview).
