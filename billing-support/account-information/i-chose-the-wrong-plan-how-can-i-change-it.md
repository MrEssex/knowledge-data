# I chose the wrong plan, how can I change it?

Not a problem at all, simply email [billing@hostgrid.com](mailto:billing@hostgrid.com?subject=%7B%7Bbrand.displayName%7D%7D%20Plan%20Selection) and we will be able to quickly get you on the right plan.

If a refund is applicable it will be processed there and then and should be back to your card within 7-10 working days as an absolute maximum and PayPal customers up to 5 working days maximum.
