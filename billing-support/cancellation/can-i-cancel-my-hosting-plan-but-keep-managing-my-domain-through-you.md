# Can I cancel my hosting plan, but keep managing my domain through you?

As a web host, we require all customers to have an active hosting subscription with us to access their accounts. Without an active subscription, you will not be able to access your control panel to manage your domain. If you cancel your hosting subscription you will need to transfer your domain to another host or domain registrar.
