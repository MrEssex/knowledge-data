# Do you have a money back guarantee?

Our annual hosting plans offer a 30 day money back guarantee *(14 days for monthly customers and additional services)*, allowing you time to try out our tools and build the website you’ve always wanted to.  If during that time you decide we aren’t the host for you just let us know and we’ll refund your initial payment, minus any domain costs if you registered a new domain with us.  Your domain is then yours to take to another web host.
